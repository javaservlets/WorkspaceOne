# Device Posture - VMWare WorkstationONE

This ForgeRock Authentication Tree queries a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system to see whether or not the end-user's device satisfies a Compliance Policy (ie, checks it's "Device Posture") before it is allowed to access a protected resource.

A unique identifier is needed for said query, thus you need to leverage the MDM's capability to issue and distribute x509 "mutual certificates" (also known as "browser" or "client" certificates) to each device it enrolls, with the device's unique identifier (populated in the 'CN' field of the x509 certificate).

Since you will also configure Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) on the server running ForgeRock Open Access Manager, each time a device interfaces with ForgeRock, it is requested *and required* to present it's client certificate. 

The authentication tree below is configured to extract the device's unique identifier from the CN field in the presented certificate; with that in hand, the authentication tree next makes a ReST query to the MDM for Device Posture information.

The MDM can return 1 of 3 results:

1. the device is unknown to the MDM
2. the device is known to the MDM but fails to pass their Compliance checklist (ie, OS is not up to date, phone is jailbroken, PIN has not been set, etc)
3. the device is known and it passes their Compliance checklist

Only in event #3 is returned does the authentication tree carry on; if #2 is returned an additional step-up challenge could optionally be issued; if #1 is returned tree exits altogether. 


### Configuration: VMWare WorkstationONEa and mTLS

The details for configuring VMWare and Mutual Authentication are [here](./config/VMWare.md).


### Configuration: ForgeRock Authentication Node


Once the above has been done and verified, configure an Authentication Tree as follows:

1. Download the Auth Node that extracts the unique identifier from the x509 from https://github.com/javaservlets/CertificateReader
2. Copy that CertificateReader.jar *plus* the VMWare*.jar from the below ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.
3. Restart the web container to pick up the new nodes.  The two nodes will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
4. From the components pallete select the Certificate Reader node and configure it this manner: ![ScreenShot](./config/1.png)
5. From the components pallete select the VMWare node and configure it this manner: ![ScreenShot](./config/2.png)
6. From the components pallete select the Success node and configure it this manner: ![ScreenShot](./config/3.png)
7. For the case where the MDM returns a 'non-compliant' status, it is up to you to decide if you want to perform an additional step-up challenge, display a message, redirect, account lockout, etc.
8. Click on the VMWare node and enter your account-specific values for:
	9. VMWare Server
	10. VMWare Key
	12. Admin Username
	13. Admin Password
